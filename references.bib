abstract = {This paper reports the development of a high-resolution 3-D MRI atlas of the Fischer 344 adult rat brain. The atlas is a 60 $\mu$m isotropic image volume composed of 256 coronal slices with 71 manually delineated structures and substructures. The atlas was developed using Pydpiper image registration pipeline to create an average brain image of 41 four-month-old male and female Fischer 344 rats. Slices in the average brain image were then manually segmented, individually and bilaterally, on the basis of image contrast in conjunction with Paxinos and Watson's (2007) stereotaxic rat brain atlas. Summary statistics (mean and standard deviation of regional volumes) are reported for each brain region across the sample used to generate the atlas, and a statistical comparison of a chosen subset of regional brain volumes between male and female rats is presented. On average, the coefficient of variation of regional brain volumes across all rats in our sample was 4%, with no individual brain region having a coefficient of variation greater than 13%. A full description of methods used, as well as the atlas, the template that the atlas was derived from, and a masking file, can be found on Zenodo at www.zenodo.org/record/3700210. To our knowledge, this is the first MRI atlas created using Fischer 344 rats and will thus provide an appropriate neuroanatomical model for researchers working with this strain.},

abstract = {Normal aging is associated with numerous biological changes, including altered brain metabolism and tissue chemistry. In vivo characterization of the neurochemical profile during aging is possible using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a powerful noninvasive technique capable of quantifying brain metabolites involved in physiological processes that become impaired with age. A prominent macromolecular signal underlies those of brain metabolites and is particularly visible at high fields; parameterization of this signal into components improves quantification and expands the number of biomarkers comprising the neurochemical profile. The present study reports, for the first time, the simultaneous absolute quantification of brain metabolites and individual macromolecules in aging male and female Fischer 344 rats, measured longitudinally using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 7 T. We identified age- and sex-related changes in neurochemistry, with prominent differences in metabolites implicated in anaerobic energy metabolism, antioxidant defenses, and neuroprotection, as well as numerous macromolecule changes. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neurobiological processes associated with healthy aging, critical for the proper identification and management of pathologic aging trajectories.

@article{Gorgolewski2016,
abstract = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

abstract = {Task-free functional connectivity in animal models provides an experimental framework to examine connectivity phenomena under controlled conditions and allows for comparisons with data modalities collected under invasive or terminal procedures. Currently, animal acquisitions are performed with varying protocols and analyses that hamper result comparison and integration. Here we introduce StandardRat, a consensus rat functional magnetic resonance imaging acquisition protocol tested across 20 centers. To develop this protocol with optimized acquisition and processing parameters, we initially aggregated 65 functional imaging datasets acquired from rats across 46 centers. We developed a reproducible pipeline for analyzing rat data acquired with diverse protocols and determined experimental and processing parameters associated with the robust detection of functional connectivity across centers. We show that the standardized protocol enhances biologically plausible functional connectivity patterns relative to previous acquisitions. The protocol and processing pipeline described here is openly shared with the neuroimaging community to promote interoperability and cooperation toward tackling the most important challenges in neuroscience.},
