Once the spreadsheet is filled out, investigators will be assigned a OneDrive folder for each data packet to be submitted, numbered according to their corresponding row in the study spreadsheet (DP01, DP02, etc.). During submission time, OneDrive folders will be editable only by the lead investigators (JN & CC) and the submitting investigators to avoid accidental cross-contamination between investigator data packet folders.\n\n\nMid- and long-term data storage\nIn the mid-term, following the initial data submission phase, data will be stored at EPFL/SRI on high-performance computing servers. In the long term, data storage will move to OpenNeuro, a publicly available repository, when the first preprint is submitted."

    "text": "Data processing\nData will be preprocessed using FID-A and Osprey, both MATLAB-based software. A basic processing pipeline will be established, consisting of 1) coil combination, if applicable; 2) iterative retrospective frequency drift correction, if possible; 3) averaging; 4) measurement of SNR; 5) measurement of linewidth; and 6) visual inspection for artifacts. Processing scripts and visual quality inspection procedures specific to this study will be shared publicly on the CoMP-MRS GitHub repository.\nFor each provided scan, we will attempt to generate a mask of the VOI position in a standard space. This will be achieved by 1) generating a mask of the voxel position in the provided structural space; 2) registering the provided structural MRI scan with the standard rat or mouse brain template; and 3) transforming the VOI mask from the structural space into the standard template space. For the rat brain, standard space will consist of the Fischer 344 MRI-derived atlas of Goerzen et al. (2020)1. For the mouse brain, standard space will consist of the Dorr/DSURQE mouse brain MRI template.\nSpectral analysis will be performed in Osprey using a basis set that consists of a fixed list of metabolites and macromolecule peaks. Metabolite and macromolecule basis sets will be generated by JN/CC, and will be made available at the end of the study.\nFor a detailed procedure, see Analysis."

    "text": "Summary\nIn this international collaborative project, we seek to gather the rodent (rat and mouse) MRS community toward performing a multi-center comparison of 1H MRS techniques with the overriding goal of developing and establishing guidelines for best methodological practices in preclinical MRS research. Inspired by the multi-site fMRI study of the rat brain led by Joanes Grandjean1, we want to examine the distribution of neurochemical concentrations and spectral quality measures at the population level within the healthy rodent brain across sites, as well as establish best practices for preclinical MRS methods.\nTo do so, we will gather a “retrospective dataset” of short-echo time (TE) rodent brain MRS data from individual labs (n = 8 rats/mice per lab, any protocol, volume of interest in either hippocampus or striatum). Going further, we will seek to obtain additional datasets pertaining to within-lab test-retest assessment (i.e., scans that were collected in the same control animals within a period of 6 months or less). Finally, we would like to organize a standardized data collection arm of this study for labs interested (a “prospective dataset”). This would include the de novo acquisition of a dataset (n = 8) using predefined, mutually-agreed, and standardized parameters consistent across all participating labs.\nThe overall objective of this work is to establish an openly available repository of rodent brain MRS data for researchers, to publish an extensive description of the collective dataset in a peer-reviewed journal, and provide a “standardized” protocol for rat and mouse brain MRS that will enable the acquisition of reproducible and reliable MRS datasets."
