## Data structure

![](imgs/data-struc.png){width="85%" fig-align="left"}

## Data storage

### Short-term data storage on OneDrive to transfer data  

To gain access to OneDrive for data upload, each investigator should first provide details of their data packet(s) by filling in the first available row in the study spreadsheet.  Once the spreadsheet is filled out, investigators will be  assigned a OneDrive folder for each data packet to be submitted, numbered according to their corresponding row in the study spreadsheet (DP01, DP02, etc.).  During submission time, OneDrive folders will be editable only by the lead investigators (JN & CC) and the submitting investigators to avoid accidental cross-contamination between investigator data packet folders.  

### Mid- and long-term data storage

In the mid-term, following the initial data submission phase, data will be stored at EPFL/SRI on high-performance computing servers. In the long term, data storage will move to OpenNeuro, a publicly available repository, when the first preprint is submitted.

## Data processing

Data will be preprocessed using [FID-A](https://github.com/CIC-methods/FID-A) and [Osprey](https://github.com/schorschinho/osprey), both MATLAB-based software. A basic processing pipeline will be established, consisting of 1) coil combination, if applicable; 2) iterative retrospective frequency drift correction, if possible; 3) averaging; 4) measurement of SNR; 5) measurement of linewidth; and 6) visual inspection for artifacts. Processing scripts and visual quality inspection procedures specific to this study will be shared publicly on the CoMP-MRS [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jamienear/CoMP-MRS/).

For each provided scan, we will attempt to generate a mask of the VOI position in a standard space. This will be achieved by 1) generating a mask of the voxel position in the provided structural space; 2) registering the provided structural MRI scan with the standard rat or mouse brain template; and 3) transforming the VOI mask from the structural space into the standard template space. For the rat brain, standard space will consist of the [Fischer 344 MRI-derived atlas](https://zenodo.org/records/3900544) of Goerzen et al. (2020) [@Goerzen2020]. For the mouse brain, standard space will consist of the Dorr/DSURQE mouse brain MRI template.

Spectral analysis will be performed in Osprey using a basis set that consists of a fixed list of metabolites and macromolecule peaks. Metabolite and macromolecule basis sets will be generated by JN/CC, and will be made available at the end of the study.
